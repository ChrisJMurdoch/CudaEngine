Requirements:

This program has only been tested on Windows 10.

The Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable is required to run the program.

The program has optional hardware acceleration for NVIDA GPUs with architecture TESLA and up.


Using the program:

To run with Hardware acceleration, use 'cuda' as the first command line argument:
> program cuda
To run without, any or no argument can be used.

Cuda acceleration will only speed up terrain generation for around 500 vertex width and up.

To specify the width of the map to generate, use an integer as the second command line argument:
> program cuda 1000
> program nocuda 300

Terrain generation parameters can be altered in assets/generation.

Use WASD to move around the terrain, use Q and E to rotate.

You can zoom in and out of the map using the scroll wheel.
