This program has been tested only for Windows 10 and requires the Visual Studio framework to run.
The program has optional hardware acceleration for NVIDA GPUs with architecture TESLA and up.

To run with acceleration, use 'cuda' as the first cmd argument:
>   program cuda
To run without, any or no argument can be used

To specify the width in vertices of the terrain to generate, use an integer as the second argument:
>   program cuda 1500
>   program nocuda 500

Hardware acceleration will only speed up terrain generation for around 1000 vertex width and up.

This software has been has been tested and optimised for stability and performance but comes with
no guarantee.  If your computer starts making noises, it's not intended.  Close the program.
