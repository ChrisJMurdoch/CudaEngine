This program has been tested only for Windows 10 and requires the Visual Studio framework to run.
The program has optional hardware acceleration for NVIDA GPUs with architecture TESLA and up.

To run with acceleration, use 'cuda' as the first cmd argument:
>   program cuda
To run without, any or no argument can be used.

Terrain generation parameters can be altered in assets/generation.kval.

Hardware acceleration will only speed up terrain generation for around 1000 vertex width and up.

glfw3.dll is included for those who do not wish to install it themselves, however building from
source will provide better OS specific optimisations in the library.



Using the program

Use WASD to move around the terrain, use Q and E to rotate around the centre of focus.

You can scroll in and out of the map using the scroll wheel.

You can also erode the terrain over time by holding SPACE.
