# CudaEngine

C++ Terrain generation and rendering engine with optional hardware acceleration.

## Requirements

The **Visual Studio framework** is required to run the program.

The **NVCC** Compiler is needed to compile the .cu kernel files.

**NVIDIA Tesla** and up is required to run with hardware acceleration.

## Running

To run the engine with hardware acceleration, no command line arguments are required.

To use the acceleration features, use "cuda" as the first command line argument.
